==== Content ====

This example introduces further (and new) concepts of '''wiki2beamer''' (and \LaTeX\ Beamer):

* Overlays
* Environments
** Plain \LaTeX{}: Center, %
%
%
Flushright, \ldots
** \LaTeX{} Beamer: Block, Example, \ldots
* Columns
* Substitutions
* Footnotes
* Manual Frame Closing

==== Overlays ====

*<1-> Overlays are a very useful concept of the beamer class
*<2-> They can be used to uncover content step by step
*<3-> They can be used for list items
*<4-> Or for any other type of content \\[4mm]

\only<4->{\includegraphics[width=6cm]{fig/rainbow}}


==== Overlays in wiki2beamer ====

Here is the source code for the preceding slide -- I guess it should be very much self-explanatory: \\[8mm]

{\tt
  *<1-> Overlays are very useful concept of the beamer class \\
  *<2-> They can be used to uncover content step by step \\
  *<3-> They can be used for list items \\
  *<4-> Or for any other type of content $\backslash$$\backslash$[4mm] \\
\ \\
  $\backslash$only$<$4-$>\{$$\backslash$includegraphics[width=6cm]$\{$fig/rainbow$\}\}$
}


==== Environments ====

* \LaTeX\ comes with a number of different environments:
** center
** flushright
** and many more \\[3mm]

* \LaTeX\ Beamer includes further environments that are quite useful for presentation slides
** boxes
** examples
** theorems

Have a look at the next slide, to see some of the environments in action.


==== Environments in action ====

<[center]
This is centered text.
[center]>

<[flushright]
This is right-justified text.
[flushright]>

<[block]{Hello World.}
This is boxed text.
[block]>

<[example]
This is an example.
[example]>


==== Environments in wiki2beamer ====

You can use plain \LaTeX{} code to create such environments, of course. However, '''wiki2beamer'''
offers you a shortcut: \\[6mm]

{\tt
  $<$[center] \\
  This is centered text. \\ {}
  [center]$>$ \\[6mm]
}

Thus, $<$[\ldots] will be tranformed into $\backslash$begin$\{$\ldots$\}$. Please pay attention to these two issues:

* Environment definitions have to start at the first line character
* The user takes full responsibility for closing !all! opened environments


==== Parameters to environments ====

As stated on the preceding slide, '''wiki2beamer''' simply transforms the

<[center]
{\tt $<$[\ldots] \hspace{5mm} [\ldots]$>$ }
[center]>

to $\backslash$begin and $\backslash$end commands. \\[6mm]

Hence, it is possible to add different kind of parameters to the environment you want to use. \\[2mm]

<[block]{An example}
This block was created like this:

{\tt
  $<$[block]$\{$An example$\}$ \\
  \ldots \\ {}
  [\ldots]$>$
}
[block]>


==== Columns ====

\LaTeX\ Beamer introduced another environment which is handy which presentation slides: !columns!. \\[4mm]

<[columns]
[[[5cm]]]
They can be used to place the slide content in a number of different columns. For example, the text could be on the
left side, as it is the case on this page. And the right side could be used to show an image.

[[[5cm]]]
\includegraphics[width=4.5cm]{fig/rainbow}
[columns]>


==== Columns in wiki2beamer ====

Use this syntax to create columns in '''wiki2beamer''': \\[4mm]

{\tt
  $<$[columns] \\ {}
  [[[5cm]]] \\
  Text \ldots \\
\ \\ {}
  [[[5cm]]] \\
  $\backslash$includegraphics[width=4.5cm]$\{$fig/rainbow$\}$ \\{}
  [columns]$>$ \\[4mm]
}

The length parameter between [[[ and ]]] specifies the column width.



==== Substitutions ====

'''wiki2beamer''' will transform a few common ASCII symbols to their typographically correct equivalents: \\[4mm]

* -{-}$>$ becomes ! --> ! (\$$\backslash$rightarrow\$)
* $<$-{-} becomes ! <-- ! (\$$\backslash$leftarrow\$)
* ==$>$ becomes ! ==> ! (\$$\backslash$Rightarrow\$)
* $<$== becomes ! <== ! (\$$\backslash$Leftarrow\$)
* :{-}) becomes ! :-) ! ($\backslash$smiley, requires package wasysym)
* :{-}( becomes ! :-( ! ($\backslash$frownie, requires package wasysym)

\vspace{3mm}
These symbols have to be preceeded and followed by at least one whitespace character.


==== Footnotes ====

Footnotes(((as you can see here))) are quite useful on some occasions. Using '''wiki2beamer''', they can be
created like this: \\[6mm]

{\tt
  Footnotes({(}(as you can see here){)}) are quite useful on some occasions.
}


=! Exuberant Title Top !=


==== Exuberant Title Top ====

Exuberant title top(((http://presentationpatterns.com/glossary/\#exuberanttitletop))) is a popular presentation technique.
A technique that allows you to place a core idea on the center of the slide and then add supporting
elements underneath as the main idea migrates to the top of the slide.

This techniques is a good way
to grab viewers attention that a transition of topic is about
to occur.

The slide before was created using the code below:
<[block]{Example}
{\tt
   {=\! Exuberant Title Top \!=}
}
[block]>






==== Manual Frame Closing ====

If you want to write \LaTeX\ code outside of the frame environment
you can manually close the frame (which was opened by {\tt ====}) via:

'''wiki2beamer''' syntax: {\tt [frame]$>$}

'''wiki2beamer''' detects these when at the beginning of a line and then
consideres the frame closed.

[frame]>

\defverbatim\somelisting{
<[verbatim]
\defverbatim\somelisting{
Some verbatim code
as a \defverbatim
outside of a frame.

Can be referenced
as \somelisting
later.
}
[verbatim]>
}

==== Manual Frame Closing ====

This verbatim code was defined via {\tt $\backslash$defverbatim} outside
the frame and then included via it's name:

\pause

<[block]{Some Listing}

\somelisting

[block]>

==== Finally... ====

<[center]
\huge The End.
